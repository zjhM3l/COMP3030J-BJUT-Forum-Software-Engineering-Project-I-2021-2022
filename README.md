I decided to make a web forum mainly face to BJUT students. Students can
publish new posts on the forum and interact with other posts. Also, the forum
can search for old posts by keywords, visits hotness ranking, and recommendation
degree. Meanwhile, the system administrator can manage users, posts, delete or
ban inappropriate content, and send announcements or notifications to users. The
forum will also be divided into several different sections for students to access
specific content as well as for administrators to manage it effectively.
